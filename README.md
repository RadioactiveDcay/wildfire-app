# Wildfire App

## Description

Projects are extremely important on your journey to becoming a full-stack web developer. As you get further along in the boot camp, you’ll find opportunities to apply for web developer roles. Among the first requirements you’ll need to even get an interview are high-quality deployed examples of your work featured in your portfolio.

This project will be a centerpiece for your portfolio and your first opportunity to show employers your collaborative skills and coding abilities. Employers want to see what you can do, but they also want to see how you work with other developers. The more examples of deployed collaborative work you have in your portfolio, the more likely you are to get an interview and a job. One of the requirements for this project is that you add it to your portfolio.
